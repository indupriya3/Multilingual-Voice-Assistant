## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Microphone not working**: 
   - Ensure browser permissions for microphone access
   - Check if HTTPS is enabled (required for some browsers)
   - Verify microphone is working in system settings

2. **Backend connection errors**:
   - Verify MongoDB is running on port 27017
   - Check if backend server is running on port 8001
   - Ensure frontend .env has correct REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL

3. **Speech recognition not working**:
   - Use Chrome or Edge browsers (best Web Speech API support)
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Speak clearly and avoid background noise

4. **Translation errors**:
   - Check internet connection (required for Google Translate)
   - Verify the target language is in the supported list
   - Ensure the text is not empty or too long

### Performance Tips

- Clear command history periodically for better performance
- Use a good quality microphone for better speech recognition
- Ensure stable internet connection for translation features
- Close unnecessary browser tabs while using the voice assistant
